In my Anaplan Model: Auto Builder Model, I want to create the following: 

Lists: 

- Accounts: Distinguish between capital expenses (CapEx) and operational expenses (OpEx) by account type.
- Cost Centers: For both CapEx and OpEx, associate costs with various departments or functions.
- Projects (for CapEx): Track capital expenditures by project or investment.
- Expense Categories (for OpEx): Define categories like utilities, rent, salaries, etc.

And these two modules: 

1. CapEx Module
- Project Cost: Number format. 
- Depreciation Start Date. 
- Useful Life
- Depreciation Expense: With formula "Project Cost / Useful Life"
- Net Book Value
- Capital Expenditure
- CapEx Approvals

2. OpEx Module
- Expense Amount: Number format. 
- Expense Type
- Monthly Allocation
- Total OpEx
- Variance Analysis
- Cost Center Allocations

Please suggest the rest of what is needed to complete this model.
